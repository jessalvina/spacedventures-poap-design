Welcome! Here are some of my artworks for Spacedventures POAP Design

#### 1. Space Whale: We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat!
**Challenge Description:** 
We're interested in POAPs that can engage our community! We want to see you create a piece of artwork that captures what it means to invest in the future.

A "whale" is a common title for someone that is a big trader - someone that can move a market just by themselves. Here's your chance to imagine this mythical creature among the stars. What might a Space Whale look like?
